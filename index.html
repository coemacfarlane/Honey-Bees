              Every bee has a role to play in the hive. The Queen stays with the
              colony and reproduces with the drones. Worker bees maintain the
              hive and can be broken into two groups: House bees remain in the
              hive processing honey and taking care of larvae while forager bees
              leave to collect nectar.

              Finding a flower, the forager bee will drink the nextar to store

              flower outside, the bee also spreads pollen that is important for
              plant reproduction in the Spring.

              Enzymes within the bees break down the sugars in the nectar as
              they pass it between each other. House bees continue passing the
              honey between each other until the water level is low enough to
              store it.

              Bees don't just make honey â€” they're also important pollinators!
              Without bees' help we wouldn't have the beautiful plants or food
              we enjoy on a daily basis. They're an important part of almost
              every ecosystem but they're in danger.
            </p>
            <p>
              Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) has been threatening bee
              populations for years. This is when the worker bees abandon a
              queen and seemingly healthy hive. There may be a Queen and some
              nurse bees left but a hive cannot sustain itself without workers
              and will eventually die.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the reported cases of incidence have slowed over the last
              five years, bee colonies are still being lost and overall bee
              health continues to suffer. CCD is horrible but it is not the only
              threat to bees. Pesticides, invasive species, alterations to
              habitat, inadequate forage and poor nutrition are all dangerous to
              honey bees and thus, by extension, our environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              The causes of colony collapse may not be fully known, but the
              cause of most other above listed threats are. Farming, expanding
              suburbs, and growing cities have a massive toll on the environment
              as they take land that bees (and other animals) once lived on
              while utilizing massive amounts of chemicals.
            </p>
            <p>
              You and I alone may not be able to change the affects man-kind has
              on nature, but organizing and educating yourself and your
              community on these issues can lead to great things. Even just
              starting a small garden of native species can have a bigger effect
              than you know.
